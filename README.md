# 🌦️ Real-Time Weather Tracker 
### _Big Data Analytics Mini Project | Live Dashboard Mode_

> 🚀 Developed by **Atharva Karle**  
> An interactive, data-driven weather monitoring system that visualizes real-time climate conditions with analytical precision and Big Data insights.

---

## 🧭 **Project Overview**

**Real-Time Weather Tracker** is an advanced **Big Data Analytics** project designed to demonstrate the power of continuous data streaming and visualization.  
It collects live weather parameters — **Temperature**, **Humidity**, and **Wind Speed** — using the **Open-Meteo API**, logs them periodically, and generates a **real-time visual dashboard** for monitoring and analytics.

The system blends **real-time data engineering** with **statistical interpretation**, making it a perfect showcase of modern data analytics pipelines in action.

---

## 🌍 **Core Concept**

This project functions as a **live weather analytics engine**.  
Every 30 seconds, it:
- Retrieves updated weather data for a user-specified city  
- Logs each entry into structured storage (CSV & JSON)  
- Dynamically updates a live temperature trend chart  
- Generates key analytical metrics such as average, max, min, and variance  

Through this process, it simulates **Big Data ingestion and visualization** in real time — a crucial component of modern analytical systems.

## 📊 **Key Features**

✨ **Real-Time Visualization**  
Continuously updated temperature trend displayed via Matplotlib in live mode.

📡 **Live Data Acquisition**  
Fetches real-time data from Open-Meteo API for any global city.

💾 **Big Data Logging**  
Continuously stores all readings into structured CSV and JSON files.

📈 **Automated Statistical Insights**  
Generates live metrics — average, maximum, minimum, and variance — after each run.

💻 **Dynamic Dashboard Interface**  
Interactive temperature trend dashboard for real-time observation.

🌡️ **Precision Analysis**  
Monitors micro-level temperature fluctuations with accurate timestamps.
